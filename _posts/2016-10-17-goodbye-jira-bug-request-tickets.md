title: Goodbye Jira (Bug/Request tickets)
author: dmsparer

All,

New user registration and new ticket creation has been turned off on Jira. Please create all new bug/request tickets over on our GitHub Issues page: [https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues](https://github.com/mRemoteNG/mRemoteNG/issues)

<!--more-->

We will be moving over the current Jira tickets to GitHub in the coming days. Tickets can still be updated in Jira, and will remain that way until they are migrated to GitHub.
