Hello all,

I’d like to announce that we have created a public chat room for mRemoteNG! We are using Gitter, which ties into GitHub nicely (including login).

Feel free to come say ‘hi’. The development team will be in the room a fair amount of the time, though do keep in mind that we may not always be able to answer (we are all in the US).
