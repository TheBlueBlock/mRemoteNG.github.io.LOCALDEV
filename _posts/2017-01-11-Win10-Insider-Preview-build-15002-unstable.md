We've been getting a few reports that the Win10 Insider Preview build 15002 is unstable when used with mRemoteNG (among other programs). So far, this appears to be an issue with the OS update and will need to be resolved by Microsoft. We are doing a bit of testing on our end too, just to be sure.

If you are running this OS build, you will likely receive a green-screen-of-death when starting mRemoteNG. If you can, provide data to Microsoft on any errors you see. Otherwise, we have provided a link below on how to potentially roll back the update.
